Breakout boards for the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 (Xiao BLE) and up to two 74HC595 Shift Registers. Taking inspiration from the [revxlp](https://gitlab.com/lpgalaxy/revxlp), using two pogopins to reach the backside pads of the Xiao BLE

*XiaoBLE__2xSR_SMD* used the surface mound 74HC595 Shift Registers

*XioaBLE__2xSR_TH* uses the throuh hole version of the 74HC595 Shift register, all other components are the same.

*status: PCB's in production, untested.*
